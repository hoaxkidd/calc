calc
----

**calc** (for want of a better name) is a simple scientific calculator written in Python.

It supports:

* Operators: associativity and precedence (BEDMAS), unary operators, functions.
* Implicit multiplication (`2 x y` is interpreted as `2 * x * y`).
* Extensible: new operators can be defined trivially.
