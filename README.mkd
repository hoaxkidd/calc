calc

**calc** (for want of a better name) is a simple scientific calculator written in Python.


Features

* Operators: associativity and precedence (BEDMAS), unary operators, functions.
* Implicit multiplication: `2(x + 1)y` is interpreted as `2 * (x + 1) * y`.
* Extensible: new operators can be defined trivially.


Run
---

**calc** uses Python 2.
